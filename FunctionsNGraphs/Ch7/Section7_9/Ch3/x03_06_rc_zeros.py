Theorem: If f(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 0
and has real coefficients and if z is a complex
zero of f(x), then the conjugate z-bar of z is
also a zero of f(x)

"""
Theorem: Every polynomial with real coefficients and 
positive degree n can be expressed as a product of 
linear and quadratic polynomials with real coefficients 
where the quadractic factors have no real zeros
"""

"""
Theorem of Rational Zeros: Suppose that 
f(x) = a_n*x**n + a_{n-1}*x**(n-1) + ...
+ a_1*x**1 + a_0 is a polynomial with
integer coeffcients. If c/d is a rational
zero of f(x), where c and d have no common
prime factors and c > 0, then c is a factor
of a_0 and d is a factor of a_n.
