'''
A function f is a **rational function** if, for all x in its
domain:

f(x) = g(x)/h(x)

where g(x) and h(x) aer polynomials. Of majoer importance are
the zeros of the numerator and denominator. _Throughout this
section we shall assume that g(x) and h(x) have no common factors,
and hence, no common zeros. 

Note that f(c) = 0 if and only if g(c) = 0, and hence the zeros
of the numerator g(x) are teh zeros of f(x).

However, if c is a zero of the demonimator, h(x), then
f(c) = g(c)/0 is undefined, and hence the behavior of f(x) 
requires special attention when x is near c!
